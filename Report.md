# SEGMENTING AND CLUSTERING NEIGHBORHOODS WITH LEVEL OF RISK FROM COVID-19

# Introduction

Where does Coronavirus spread the most? At a time when India is likely to end its third phase of Coronavirus lockdown on May 17, there are some points that need to be taken into account while planning the exit strategy. Across the world, 14 studies have been conducted with a similar conclusion that public enclosed places like restaurants and workplaces can act as COVID-19 super-spreading environments, the Indian Express reported. Meanwhile in India, density is still a huge concern. Through this project, we will cluster and segement neighborhood of India's capital - Delhi. It should give us insights like the area where we are most likely to get COVID-19. Further, the results can be used by the state government to impliment policies to crub coronavirus effectively while ending the lockdown.


# Data Source
I will be using 4 data sources in this project:

* Postal code with geo-coordinates of Delhi to divide the city into neighborhood. 
* Foursquare API to get the venues data around each neighborhood - it will help us identify neighborhood and the level of risk.
* District wise polulation density of Delhi - highly dense areas will be more prone to coronavirus.
* District wise data of containment zones in Delhi - current hotspots/containment zones of coronavirus will help us mark areas with high level of risk.
